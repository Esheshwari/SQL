-- 1. Display employee names along with their department names using INNER JOIN.
SELECT e.name AS employee, d.dept_name
FROM employees e
JOIN departments d ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id;

-- 2. List all departments and employees, even if some departments have no employees using RIGHT OUTER JOIN.
-- MySQL does not support RIGHT JOIN with the same clarityâ€”use LEFT JOIN from employees to departments reversed:
SELECT d.dept_name, e.name AS employee
FROM departments d
LEFT JOIN employees e ON d.dept_id = e.dept_id;

-- 3. Display the average salary per department using GROUP BY.
SELECT d.dept_name, AVG(e.salary) AS avg_salary
FROM employees e
JOIN departments d ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id
GROUP BY d.dept_id;

-- 4. Find the maximum salary among all employees.
SELECT MAX(salary) AS max_salary FROM employees;

-- 5. Calculate the total salary expenditure of the company.
SELECT SUM(salary) AS total_payroll FROM employees;
